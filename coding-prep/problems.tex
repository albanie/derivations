Many of these questions are not gathered from a single location, but instead gathered from various posts on forums.  Where possible, I have tried to provide a link to the source of the question.

\subsection{Longest Increasing Subsequence} \label{question:longest-increasing-subsequence}

Given an unsorted array, find the longest (not necessarily consecutive) sequence of increasing numbers (solution \ref{solution:longest-increasing-subsequence}).

\subsection{TwoSum} \label{question:two-sum}

Find all pairs of numbers in an unsorted array that add up to a certain target (solution \ref{solution:two-sum}).

\subsection{ThreeSum} \label{question:two-sum}

Find all triplets of numbers in an unsorted array that add up to a certain target (solution \ref{solution:three-sum}).
